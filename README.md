# BankPy
A simple project that emulates a bank. Users can register accounts, deposit, transfer or withdraw their money.

Through banco.py the user sees options 1 - 6 (create an account, withdraw money, deposit money, transfer money,
list accounts or exit the system).

This project was originally created as part of my Python course with Geek University.

I am currently making improvements through the use of try/except, while loops, adding comments, etc as part of
my RAD with Python university course.
